## Setup:

1. _Telegram.au3_ is the main file that you have to include in your project, but it also need the _include_ folder. Adjust the path as you want.
2. Include it in your script: `#include "Telegram.au3"`
3. **First**, initialize your bot: `_InitBot(12345678:AbCdEfGh....)`
4. **Then** you can use all the bot functions.

## How it works:
After initializing the bot, you can do whatever you need to do. (Almost) all the API are coded, read the wiki for details about all the functions. To put the bot in _Polling state_ (mean a blocking function that wait for incoming messages) read below.

### How to wait for incoming messages:

To wait incoming messages you have to put the bot in Polling State. This state is **blocking**, therefore your script wait here until it's closed or it exit from the while, maybe if a certain condition is verified.

A basic example:

```autoit
While 1 ;Create a While that restart Polling
	$msgData = _Polling() ;_Polling function return an array with information about a message
	_SendMsg($msgData[2],$msgData[5]) ;Send a message to the same user with the same text
WEnd
```
For a simple text message, the array returned by _Polling() is:
*	$msgData[0] = Offset of the current update (used to 'switch' to next update)
*	$msgData[1] = Message ID
*	$msgData[2] = Chat ID, use for interact with the user
*	$msgData[3] = Username of the user
*	$msgData[4] = First name of the user
*	$msgData[5] = Text of the message
